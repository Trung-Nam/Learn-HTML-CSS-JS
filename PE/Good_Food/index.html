                <h1>Mi Quang</h1>
                <p>Without a doubt, the most underrated dish in Vietnam is Mi Quang. Mi quang may be available at most
                    restaurants in Vietnam, but it actually originates from Da Nang. Easily distinguished by its
                    yellow-coloured rice noodles, this dish is a hearty mix of bone broth seasoned with fish sauce,
                    black pepper, shallot, and garlic, as well as meaty ingredients such as river shrimp, boiled quails
                    eggs, and roast pork.</p>
                <p>There is no correct way to cook Mi Quang – it really depends on your tastes and preferences. To most
                    of Danangians, the best Mi Quang is home-made by their mothers or grandmothers, attached with love
                    and memories. Mi Quang brings out the feeling of genuineness and simplicity just like the people in
                    Central Vietnam, one that is hard to come across in the modern dishes</p>

                <h1>SPING ROLLS</h1>
                <p>Another famous Vietnamese food is spring rolls. It’s usually served as an appetizer at restaurants in
                    Vietnam. This healthy food is a smart choice for you when you’ve eaten too much of the fried food in
                    Vietnam. Spring rolls have meat, rice noodles, shrimp or other seafood and a layer of vegetable.
                    It’s gently rolled with ricepaper. You eat it with fish sauce. It costs 8.000 VND per roll. You will
                    absolutely like it.</p>
                <p>Fried spring roll was brought to Hanoi from the Southern part of vietnam and this dish has rapidly
                    become a favorite one of Hanoian, and to express the affection as well as to remember the real
                    origin of the dish, people here call it “Nem Sai Gon”.</p>
